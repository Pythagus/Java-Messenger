# Java Messenger tools
This folder contains the Messenger tools used by both client and tomcat server sides.

## Installation
There is no need to install. The current repository contains a `jar` file compiling the current tools. This `jar` 
is in the [lib folder](../lib) at the repository's root.

### Folder
A `Makefile` script is available avoiding you to manually do some part of the following installation
guide.

#### Makefile
The `Makefile` provides some useful commands:
- `make cp-jar` to copy the generated `.jar` file to the [lib folder](../lib).
- `make cpj` is an alias of `make cp-jar`
